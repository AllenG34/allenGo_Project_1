Inspiration
===========

Before I started my game I had to look at inspiration and examples of how to start a tic tac toe game.

I used websites like https://www.codebrainer.com/blog/tic-tac-toe-javascript-game to help unblock my mind of how to start.

I also used https://www.w3schools.com/ to help with my coding to ensure I was doing everything right.

Once I was finished with everything I also used https://unsplash.com/ to add a nice background to my game.
